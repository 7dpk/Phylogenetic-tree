# Phylogenetic-tree
This code parses a FASTA file of DNA sequences, calculates n-gram distances between them, builds a phylogenetic tree using neighbor joining, and prints the tree. It clusters similar sequences together based on short sequence matches, giving an quick phylogenetic analysis of the input data.
